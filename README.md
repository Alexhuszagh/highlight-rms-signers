# Highlight RMS Supporters
A cross-platform utility to highlight RMS support letter signers.

# Releases

Pre-built extensions are provided under the [releases](/releases) page.

# Developing

In order to create a simple, cross-platform browser extension with code re-use, we have a single `src` folder and `icons` directory, which are then distributed with the platform-specific manifests to create the package. All the tools to generate these dist packages can be found under `tools`.
